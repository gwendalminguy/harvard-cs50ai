# Search

This directory focuses on the [first lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbzNRTTrX0g&t=1s) of the class about **Search**, covering the following subjects:

- Search Problems
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search
- Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning

It contains two projects:

* [degrees](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/harvard-cs50ai/tree/main/search/degrees), a program that determines how many "degrees of separation" apart two actors are.
* [tictactoe](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/harvard-cs50ai/tree/main/search/tictactoe), a program playing Tic-Tac-Toe optimally by implementing a MiniMax algorithm.
