# Knights

This program solves [Knights and Knaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves) logic puzzles, in which each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth, and a knave will always lie.

## Understanding

This program solves four of these puzzles, described in `puzzle.py`, by representing them using **propositional logic**. Each puzzle's knowledge is built using **logical connectives**, which is then used by the program to draw conclusions about the identity of each character.

## Usage

The program can be launched as follows:

```
$ python3 puzzle.py
```

Conclusions for each puzzle are then printed to the terminal.
