# Knowledge 

This directory focuses on the [second lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWQLez87vqM) of the class about **Knowledge**, covering the following subjects:

- Propositional Logic
- Entailment
- Inference
- Model Checking
- Resolution
- First Order Logic

It contains two projects:

* [knights](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/harvard-cs50ai/tree/main/knowledge/knights), a program solving "knights and knaves" logic puzzles.
* [minesweeper](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/harvard-cs50ai/tree/main/knowledge/minesweeper), a program playing Minesweeper optimally by infering knowledge.
