# Neural Networks

This directory focuses on the sixth lecture of the class about neural networks, covering the following subjects:

- Artificial Neural Networks
- Activation Functions
- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation
- Overfitting
- TensorFlow
- Image Convolution
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks

It contains one project:

* [traffic](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/harvard-cs50ai/tree/main/neural_networks/traffic), a program that trains a model to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.
